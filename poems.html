              <h1> "A Cringe Apology to Her" (03/03/2024) </h1><br>

Why are you hurt? <br>
Is it just me, <br>
Or is ot the wound that's cut? <br>
 <br> <br>
Do you even care <br>
That you're not alone? <br>
Is it even fair—or so one thinks— <br>
That we're the one in affair? <br>
 <br> <br>
I don't love you, nor do you to me; <br>
But we kiss sometimes for our own sake. <br>
I got nothing, but the life's stew; <br>
"Damn, man! Shit's not a piece of cake." <br>
 <br> <br>
I have a shot at things, <br>
For curiosity wins me over. <br>
'Tis sometimes I fail the ding, <br>
And the games fuck me over. <br>
 <br> <br>
Here's me, writing a poetry <br>
For—I guess—the second time. <br>
But for you, Arpita, I hope to <br>
Let's play Sky sometime! <br>
 <br> <br> <br> <br>

The word (09/05/2024)
How did you add a meaning
To the word 'Together'?
How do you reckon that I'm all in
Into the word 'Forever'?


Relatable (11/05/2024)
How did your presence
At once
Made all those love songs relatable?
Are you the one
Who made my loving heart inflamable?
Say that you are
Say that you're mine
For nobody comes close
I'll never leave you behind.


My sunshine (16/05/2024)
Oh, girl, I'll worship you like a shrine,
My holy devine.
I truly do wanna call you "mine".
Never want to see you cryin'.
All day, all night, I yearn to see you shine;
To see you smile,
Even when you're drunk on seven glasses of wine.
When you're bloomin', I'll turn out fine.
'Cause when you're groovin', I'll be in cloud nine!


Low tides (19/05/2024)
There will be nights with no goodbyes;
There will be days when you've got no smiles;
But even when through those harsh times,
Will we soar together through the skies
Like it's been a rough day, and end it with our two sighs.

Even with all those wailes and cries,
Just stick with me, and there'll be alrights.
Even when there's no one besides
Me, we'll make it together and tomorrow'll be nice.


Dadda Loves His Mommy 
(26/05/2024)    
My love, my life;
Sleep well, holdin' me tight.
Oh, yeah, Arpita meri future wife;
Baby, I love you; I do it right.

Be my mommy, I'll be your baby
I'll be your dadda, and let's do it daily.
I love it, I love you. You, me, baby.
I'll be waiting — years — for us to do it daily.
Haan, bae, we'll do it daily.


Love You Anyway (26/05/2024)
I love you, bae,
I wanna stay
With you, night and day;
And never be away.


Fight! (26/04/2024)
We fight our demons, our fears,
The skies, those tears.
Be brave, my dear,
I'll be here, to you somewhere near.

On the borders, the war.
In light is the poor.
Rushing away, deep to the lore,
Only, only, to deep roar.

To road the lion inside of me;
Slay those dragons,
Ride those wagons,
The car driver inside of me
The hardship, the lie of me.


Hero (03/06/2024)
The velocity is instantaneous
As time tends to zero.
All the sufferings are horrendous,
When I can't call my hero.


I'll be (03/06/2024)
I'll be happy when you are.
I'll be a saddie when you are.
I'll be happy when it's you.
I'll be a saddie when you're blue.


Incompleteness (04/06/2024)
A night without a "goodnight"
Is like a flight taken upright.
And a fight without a "goodbye"
Is like jumping off a great height.

I can't write any good
When I'm without you
I can't be in the mood
To try to see the morning dew.

When my sunshine's not near
It's all dark, it's not fun, dear
All I scare is your absence, my fear
I want you, that's clear.


To the best girl forever
(06/06/2024)
Did I ever say that you're the one for me?
I have forever held this in my heart,
My sunken love for thee.
And I never knew, you had a similar part.
I wish until the end, it's just we.

You, pretty girl, are stranded in the mist;
Amidst it all, you must pave your way.
Don't lose hope, don't let go, don't think you missed.
I will be on the other side, faraway;
It's not something that's forever, miss.

What is forever, though, is our bond,
Our love, our trust, our need of each-other.
Our language don't need a single nod;
We are meant to be forever,
Like a lightning stricken lightning-rod.

Hold on to the high ground,
The pain in thy heart shall vanish away.
Hold me like you'd never dismount,
It won't take long for you to pave the way.
And hence can we scale this great mount.

Even if you think so, you're none to blame.
You did here nothing wrong;
Why do you think you ignited this flame?
That's why I want you to be strong;
And no, it's not "the same".

In the end, it'll be just us;
No matter when, no matter where.
So, please, hold on and discuss
With yourself about what you scare.
Stay strong, and we'll be together forever thus.


I need you the most (07/06/2024)
It's been a while since we talked.
Not gonna lie, it hurts in my heart.
I wanna go out with you, have a walk.
It might be rough, but it has begun to start.

I might need to break it down for you,
For you who has broken down.
My queen, I'll gift you a throne for you,
And give you the biggest crown.

I'll rip up my heart into pieces;
Scattered, shattered for you to glue.
Keep it and never give it back, I'm needless.
Paint it red, 'cause pain is blue.

I'll show you what lies underneath,
From the start, to my heart,
Till the end, and what lies beneath.
Bring me back from what I had depart.

I give my all to you, my all.
When I climb 'em hundreds,
You need to grab me when I fall.
Take good care of me, else I'd slip off the handrails.

Need you to give my pump a pump,
Like forever, it has been pumping for someone.
Didn't know it would be you, who'd never dump,
Yeah, you, you're that special one.

I need you to catch up the pace,
For it wouldn't be hard for you to fall behind.
This life is a merciless race,
Where time just won't rewind.

I'll hold you close, tight within my arm,
In those times when you feel low.
Hold you forever, will do no harm,
And hope that the time wasn't so slow.

That's one, for you, my girl.
I have to tell you: I need you.
I need to see you swirl.
There's none like you, not even a few. 

Mediator spring (08/06/2024)
I don't care if you're cool or hot
I'll forever be your fan
I'll love you forever, even I not
And for forever, I'll be your man

I know you hate the heat
But damn, guess who's the hottest 
It's impossible to beat
This "coolest girl" contest.

Despite what, you're the coolest
The one I wanna chill out with
And in spite of that, you're not cold
The one I could spend cold nights with.


Miss karte (09/06/2024)
Miss karte Momma-Dadda ka endless talks.
Miss karte when we planned to meet and walk.
It feels like an eternity, hey, but
Now, nobody knocks.
Baby, you rock.


This wall between us 
(09/06/2024)
They've pulled up these walls
To put us on halt.
They don't care, they all
Think we're the ones in fault.


Eternal promises (09/06/2024)
I'll forever be in love;
Forever feel it new.
Its engrained in my nerve
That all I love is you.

I'm scared to lose my gem,
To drift away and never be together.
Then my life would be a mayhem.
Remember, we promised "forever"?

I don't want to lose the half of me.
Without you, I'm a dead body alive.
Without you, I'd stab myself with a knife,
Because I need you for myself to thrive.

I want to promise a thousand times more
That we'll be together.
And lead our love life's lore,
Promise to be forever.


Who knew (09/06/2024)
Didn't know that you're my soulmate
Disguised as a classmate.


In the bed (09/06/2024)
One day, we'll be there
Lying together in a bed
You know what happens there 
I'll be colorful, it'll be all red.


Devoid, depart (23/06/2024)
One day, we'll be miles apart;
The day'll come when we depart,
In sorrow. We'll our part.
Atleast I could say, "I have your heart."


Smile :) (25/06/2024)
I'll write it simple,
Or won't for a while.
I love your dimples,
'Cause I see them when you smile.

When you stretch your lips wide open,
I adore that parabolic arc.
Bring 'em close to mine, no words spoken;
We touch, and that's art.

Soft, featherly, heavenly pair of skin,
Just like us, and the abyss akin.
We bear this world like flowers;
Make it our garden, the odyssey of ours.


I Know How Much You Love Me.
(09/08/2024)
O' my dear —
Forgive all what I said;
I have my fear
That I'd lose you someday.

That I'd be alone, no one's near;
That I'd be devoid, of love that we made;
That I'd speak to myself, no one'd hear.
Don't want to wake up, up to such a day.

I've said things — I don't want to repeat,
I don't want to think about.
Want to hold you close, caress, after my own defeat;
Don't want to lose, we can talk and make it out.

Things did go bad, but we withstood the heat;
I cried, shouted, it might've been too loud.
My wounds have pierced you right through that beat;
But we stand still, we are together without no one's around.

Would you, my love, please take this apology?
The fight we had, was an opportunity:
To improve ourselves, to learn us better,
To cry, to learn to adore the bad weather.

I still feel sorry for all that I've said,
But in the end, you have taken my heart.
I'll love you even after it breaks. (You wouldn't let it.)
If I would've said something, I should've paid
The prices I couldn't afford, to lose someone
That I so much adore.


Happy b'day, mo (22/09/2024)
Eins, zwei, drei, zählen bis vierzehn
and the next day, fifteen on the Big Ben.
समय बीत जाएगा, लेकिन तू ना बदलना
Ar = input("Weil you're सबसे best ना!")

Still in pain, punches in dem Bauch;
Stark wie du bist, you're the hawk, not an owl.
आज के दिन भूल जाते सारा दुख,
<br> And celebrate ein Stück.

These little 24 hours shall be
your best ones in a while, may we?
Because your happiness fuels many's,
fills fat with fulfillment, even to the skinny.

And when it comes to me,
I could've never guessed what we could be
or what we could have, but now I know
that who I love is a glacier's water flow.

The purest, the kind,
the prettiest strings intertwined.
O girl, you may not reckon your worth,
I bet the best thing to me isn't but your birth.

Und wann sage ich „ich liebe dich doch“
dann meine ich alles von dir, ∞ noch.
और मैं करूंगा तुझसे हमेशा प्यार,
बस तू मुझसे शादी करले, यार|

I l♡ve you more than you think
and more than the times anyone could blink.
May count it, but not the sheeps today
because each second leads to a new play.

A new day, begin the new age
by understanding the now set-up stage
and execute not what one wants
but what you need is all that counts.

Be yourself and live up to the hype
I'll be forever loving you your type.
Be yourself but change for good
for that's a nice attitude under the hood.

Coming back to me and us,
our first time together, no fuss,
and till the eternal lasts
shall come no last pasts.

Tick-tock on the clock,
Click-clock and watch our lips lock
and adoring each elementary time
for winning over you, calling you 'mine'.

You are the best in each aspect,
so, my girl, you own all my respect.
I will be loving you right,
till the end, holding you tight.

Vierzehn, sechzehn, siebzehn und siebzig,
zählen bis infinity für ich, mich, du, dich.
For me and us together, you shan't worry,
one day we will get married.</p>
