              Why are you hurt? <br>
              Is it just me, <br>
              Or is ot the wound that's cut? <br>
              <br>
              Do you even care <br>
              That you're not alone? <br>
              Is it even fair—or so one thinks— <br>
              That we're the one in affair? <br>
              <br> 
              I don't love you, nor do you to me; <br>
              But we kiss sometimes for our own sake. <br>
              I got nothing, but the life's stew; <br>
              "Damn, man! Shit's not a piece of cake." <br>
              <br> 
              I have a shot at things, <br>
              For curiosity wins me over. <br>
              'Tis sometimes I fail the ding, <br>
              And the games fuck me over. <br>
              <br> 
              Here's me, writing a poetry <br>
              For—I guess—the second time. <br>
              But for you, Arpita, I hope to <br>
              Let's play Sky sometime! <br>

              <span class="poems">The word (09/05/2024)</span> <br> <br>
              How did you add a meaning <br>
              To the word 'Together'? <br>
              How do you reckon that I'm all in <br>
              Into the word 'Forever'? <br>

              <span class="poems">Relatable (11/05/2024)</span> <br> <br>
              How did your presence <br>
              At once <br>
              Made all those love songs relatable? <br>
              Are you the one <br>
              Who made my loving heart inflamable? <br>
              Say that you are <br>
              Say that you're mine <br>
              For nobody comes close <br>
              I'll never leave you behind. <br>

              My holy devine. <br>
              I truly do wanna call you "mine". <br>
              Never want to see you cryin'. <br>
              All day, all night, I yearn to see you shine; <br>
              To see you smile, <br>
              Even when you're drunk on seven glasses of wine. <br>
              When you're bloomin', I'll turn out fine. <br>
              'Cause when you're groovin', I'll be in cloud nine! <br>

              There will be nights with no goodbyes; <br>
              There will be days when you've got no smiles; <br>
              But even when through those harsh times, <br>
              Will we soar together through the skies <br>
              Like it's been a rough day, and end it with our two sighs. <br>
              <br> 
              Even with all those wailes and cries, <br>
              Just stick with me, and there'll be alrights. <br>
              Even when there's no one besides <br>
              Me, we'll make it together and tomorrow'll be nice. <br>

              Only, only, to deep roar. <br>

              The car driver inside of me <br>
              The hardship, the lie of me. <br>

              The velocity is instantaneous <br>
              As time tends to zero. <br>
              All the sufferings are horrendous, <br>
              When I can't call my hero. <br>

              A night without a "goodnight" <br>
              Is like a flight taken upright. <br>
              And a fight without a "goodbye" <br>
              Is like jumping off a great height. <br>
              <br> 
              I can't write any good <br>
              When I'm without you <br>

              To try to see the morning dew. <br>
              <br> 
              When my sunshine's not near <br>
              It's all dark, it's not fun, dear <br>
              All I scare is your absence, my fear <br>
              I want you, that's clear. <br>

              <span class="poems">To the best girl forever (06/06/2024)</span> <br> <br>
              Did I ever say that you're the one for me? <br>
              I have forever held this in my heart, <br>
              My sunken love for thee. <br>
              And I never knew, you had a similar part. <br>
              I wish until the end, it's just we. <br>
              <br> 
              You, pretty girl, are stranded in the mist; <br>
              Amidst it all, you must pave your way. <br>
              Don't lose hope, don't let go, don't think you missed. <br>
              I will be on the other side, faraway; <br>
              It's not something that's forever, miss. <br>
              <br> 
              What is forever, though, is our bond, <br>
              Our love, our trust, our need of each-other. <br>
              Our language don't need a single nod; <br>
              We are meant to be forever, <br>
              Like a lightning stricken lightning-rod. <br>
              <br> 
              Hold on to the high ground, <br>
              The pain in thy heart shall vanish away. <br>
              Hold me like you'd never dismount, <br>
              It won't take long for you to pave the way. <br>
              And hence can we scale this great mount. <br>
              <br> 
              Even if you think so, you're none to blame. <br>
              You did here nothing wrong; <br>
              Why do you think you ignited this flame? <br>
              That's why I want you to be strong; <br>
              And no, it's not "the same". <br>
              <br> 
              In the end, it'll be just us; <br>
              No matter when, no matter where. <br>
              So, please, hold on and discuss <br>
              With yourself about what you scare. <br>
              Stay strong, and we'll be together forever thus. <br>

              It's been a while since we talked. <br>
              Not gonna lie, it hurts in my heart. <br>
              I wanna go out with you, have a walk. <br>
              It might be rough, but it has begun to start. <br>
              <br>
              I might need to break it down for you, <br>
              For you who has broken down. <br>
              My queen, I'll gift you a throne for you, <br>
              And give you the biggest crown. <br>
              <br>
              I'll rip up my heart into pieces; <br>
              Scattered, shattered for you to glue. <br>
              Keep it and never give it back, I'm needless. <br>
              Paint it red, 'cause pain is blue. <br>
              <br> 
              I'll show you what lies underneath, <br>
              From the start, to my heart, <br>
              Till the end, and what lies beneath. <br>
              Bring me back from what I had depart. <br>
              <br> 
              I give my all to you, my all. <br>
              When I climb 'em hundreds, <br>
              You need to grab me when I fall. <br>
              Take good care of me, else I'd slip off the handrails. <br>
              <br> 
              Need you to give my pump a pump, <br>
              Like forever, it has been pumping for someone. <br>
              Didn't know it would be you, who'd never dump, <br>
              Yeah, you, you're that special one. <br>
              <br> 
              I need you to catch up the pace, <br>
              For it wouldn't be hard for you to fall behind. <br>
              This life is a merciless race, <br>
              Where time just won't rewind. <br>
              <br>
              I'll hold you close, tight within my arm, <br>
              In those times when you feel low. <br>
              Hold you forever, will do no harm, <br>
              And hope that the time wasn't so slow. <br>
              <br> 
              That's one, for you, my girl. <br>
              I have to tell you: I need you. <br>
              I need to see you swirl. <br>
              There's none like you, not even a few.  <br>

              Soft, featherly, heavenly pair of skin, <br>

              O' my dear — <br>
              Forgive all what I said; <br>
              I have my fear <br>
              That I'd lose you someday. <br>
              <br> 
              That I'd be alone, no one's near; <br>
              That I'd be devoid, of love that we made; <br>
              That I'd speak to myself, no one'd hear. <br>
              Don't want to wake up, up to such a day. <br>
              <br> 
              I've said things — I don't want to repeat, <br>
              I don't want to think about. <br>
              Want to hold you close, caress, after my own defeat; <br>
              Don't want to lose, we can talk and make it out. <br>
              <br> 
              Things did go bad, but we withstood the heat; <br>
              I cried, shouted, it might've been too loud. <br>
              My wounds have pierced you right through that beat; <br>
              But we stand still, we are together without no one's around. <br>
              <br>
              Would you, my love, please take this apology? <br>
              The fight we had, was an opportunity: <br>
              To improve ourselves, to learn us better, <br>
              To cry, to learn to adore the bad weather. <br>
              <br> 
              I still feel sorry for all that I've said, <br>
              But in the end, you have taken my heart. <br>
              I'll love you even after it breaks. (You wouldn't let it.) <br>
              If I would've said something, I should've paid <br>
              The prices I couldn't afford, to lose someone <br>

              that who I love is a glacier's water flow. <br>
              <br> 
              The purest, the kind, <br>

              May count it, but not the sheeps today <br>
              because each second leads to a new play. <br>

              by understanding the now set-up stage <br>
              and execute not what one wants <br>
              but what you need is all that counts. <br>

              for that's a nice attitude under the hood. <br>
              <br> 
              Coming back to me and us, <br>
              our first time together, no fuss, <br>
              and till the eternal lasts <br>
              shall come no last pasts. <br>
